# recipefun
Present recipes with simple JavaScript search tools.

This project scraped my favorite cooking blog and presented all the recipes on a local page with some fun features that arent available normally. The data is stored in a .js file and is loaded into the browser cache making the initial load fairly slow. However, once it is loaded all recipes can be accessed by a single autocomplete bar. Javascript updates the page dynamically so there is never a need to reload.

Really it was just to learn javascript and sharpen my python webscraping skills.

# needs work:
- Recipes are objects, tables of data are not.  Format the json better.
- all the styling
- use a database!
- figure out why directions become disordered.
- really, just recreate the thing in rails.
