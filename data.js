After removing the beef from the skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and the remaining sliced onion along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to cook the mushrooms and onions over medium until they are soft. Allow the moisture released from the onions and mushrooms to help you dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet as you stir.","Finely mince about \u00bd cup of the onion and slice the remainder of the onion. The minced onion will go in the ground beef mixture, the rest will be used for the gravy. ","Once the gravy is simmering, add the beef patties back to the skillet with the broth, mushrooms, and onions. Spoon the gravy over top, and continue to simmer the beef in the gravy for an additional five minutes. Taste the gravy and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking.","Add the beef broth and one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir to dissolve the flour into the broth, making sure to dissolve any flour that is stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to come up to simmer (still over medium heat), stirring often. Once it reaches a simmer, it will thicken into a gravy.","Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once the skillet is hot, add the shaped beef patties and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they are well browned on each side. Transfer the cooked patties to a clean plate.","Add the ground beef, minced onion, breadcrumbs, egg, 1 Tbsp of the Worcestershire sauce (the remainder will go in the gravy), Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until they are evenly combined. Divide the mixture into four equal parts, and shape each into a flattened oval.","Once the mushrooms and onions have softened and most of the moisture has evaporated off the bottom of the skillet, add the butter and flour. Continue to stir and cook for about two minutes. The flour and butter will form a paste and begin to coat the bottom of the skillet."],"2":["Preheat the oven to 425\u00baF. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.","Stretch or roll the dough out into your desired shape, making sure not to stretch it to less than \u00bc-inch thick.","Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead just a few times, or until the dough feels evenly mixed (no hard or dry pieces). Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes to relax the gluten.","Add the olive oil to the water, then pour them both into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until a shaggy ball of dough forms and no more dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. If the dough does not come together in one piece or there is still dry flour in the bowl, add a small amount of water (1 Tbsp at a time) until the dough comes together.","Place the dough on your preferred pan (prepared with either parchment or a good dusting of cornmeal or flour), then top the pizza with your favorite sauce and toppings. Bake the pizza for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and slightly browned on top. Slice and serve immediately."],"3":["Make the chimichurri first. Rinse the fresh parsley and cilantro, then drain well. Roughly chop the parsley and cilantro, then add it to a bowl along with the olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, crushed red pepper, and salt. Stir to combine, then set the dressing aside.","Rinse and drain both cans of chickpeas. Slice the grape tomatoes in half. Add the chickpeas and tomatoes to a large bowl. Crumble the feta, add it to the bowl, then drizzle the chimichurri over top. Stir to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat (up to four days)."],"4":["Combine the breadcrumbs and seasoning first. In a small bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, garlic powder, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.","Add the ground chicken to a large bowl, then add the seasoned breadcrumb mixture and the egg. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until evenly mixed.","While the meatballs are cooking, begin the pasta and sauce. Bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until tender (7-10 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander. Add the sauce to a medium sauce pot and heat over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until heated through.","Serve the cooked and drained pasta topped with sauce and meatballs.","Once all the meatballs are finished cooking, add them to the pot of heated pasta sauce and stir to coat. If needed, allow them to heat for a few minutes in the sauce.","Heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the skillet is hot and the oil is shimmering, add half of the meatballs. Cook the meatballs about one minute on each side, until all six sides are browned and the meatballs are cooked through. Transfer the cooked meatballs to a clean plate. Add the second tablespoon of cooking oil to the skillet and cook the second batch of meatballs in the same manner.","Shape the meat mixture into meatballs, about 1-1.5 Tbsp each. You should get around 20 meatballs."],"5":["Pour the icing over the cooled cake and spread until the cake is evenly covered. Slice the cake into 9 pieces and serve.","Wait until the cake is cool, then prepare the icing. Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a bowl. Begin adding water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a thick but pourable icing (about 3 Tbsp total). If you let the icing sit, it may begin to dry, but you can add a splash more water to make it moist again.","Pour the cake batter into an 8x8\" or 9x9\" baking dish. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake the cake for 35 minutes.","If using the chocolate icing, let the cake cool for at least an hour after baking before adding the icing.","Add 1 cup water to a liquid measuring cup, then add the vanilla extract and vinegar to the water. ","Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder until well combined.","Add the oil to the bowl of dry ingredients, followed by the water mixture. Stir until the chocolate cake batter is mostly smooth. Make sure no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl."]},"images":{"1":["https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Salisbury-Steak-plate-cut-V3.jpg","https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Salisbury-Steak-gravy-drizzle.jpg"],"2":["https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/No-Yeast-Pizza-Dough-V3.jpg","https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/No-Yeast-Pizza-Dough-lift-slice.jpg"],"3":["https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chimichurri-Chickpea-Salad-V.jpg","https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chimichurri-Chickpea-Salad-close.jpg"],"4":["https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chicken-Parmesan-Meatballs-bowl-V1.jpg","https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chicken-Parmesan-Meatballs-spoon.jpg"],"5":["https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chocolate-Depression-Cake-V1.jpg","https:\/\/www.budgetbytes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chocolate-Depression-Cake-slice-side.jpg"],}}
